# Requires Unity 2021 or higher
# Instructions:
## Required Settings Changes:
<ul>
  <li>If you plan to use DX12(otherwise look down below for DX11 instructions): Change the Graphics Api for Windows to DirectX12 through Edit Tab(Top Left) -> Project Settings -> Player -> Other Settings -> Untoggle "Auto Graphics API For Windows", then click the little + that appears, select "Direct3D12(Experimental)", and drag that to the top.  A restart of the editor is required</li>
  <li>Your target camera NEEDS to be deferred, this will usually be automatically done for you by TrueTrace</li>
  <li>Dynamic batching can break motion vectors a bit, so its best if this is turned off: Edit Tab -> Project Settings -> Player -> Other Settings -> Dynamic Batching</li>
  <li>I recommend turning on "GPU Skinning", as otherwise skinned meshes will freak out a bit, not horribly but its noticeable: Edit Tab -> Project Settings -> Player -> Other Settings -> GPU Skinning</li>
</ul>

## Controls:
Camera Controls: WASD, Mouse, hold right click rotate the camera, and shift increases speed

## General Setup
<ul>
  <li>Download and import the UnityPackage provided and open the new TrueTrace Settings tab at the top of the screen, and click "Arrange Hierarchy"(This WILL re-arrange your hierarchy)</li>
  <li>Its recommended you press "Auto Assign Scripts" to automatically assign the needed scripts to new objects</li>
</ul>

## Basic script structure breakdown:
<ul>
  <li>Top Level is a GameObject called Scene with an AssetManager and RayTracingMaster script attached</li>
  <li>Second Level: Parent Object Script - Attach this to all objects that will have children with meshes you want to raytrace</li>
  <li>Third Level: RayTracingObject Script - This defines what meshes get raytraced, must either be a direct child of a GameObject with the ParentObject Script, or in the same GameObject as the ParentObject Script</li>
  <li>Misc Level: Unity Lights - Must have a RayTracingLight script attached to be considered(and UseNEE needs to be on)</li>
</ul>

## General Use/Notes
<ul>
  <li>The camera you want to render from, you attach the RenderHandler script to(if you have a camera tagged MainCamera, this will be done automatically)</li>
  <li>The green/red rectangle shows when the acceleration structure is done building, and thus ready to render, red means that its not done, and green means its done building, a ding will sound when it completes if it takes longer than 15 seconds(Turn on Truetrace Settings -> Functionality Settings</li>
  <li>Objects can be added and removed at will simply by toggling the associated GameObject with a ParentObject script on/off in the hierarchy(clicking on parent objects with complex objects for children will lag), but they will take time to appear as the acceleration structure needs to  be rebuilt for them</li>
  <li>Emissive meshes need to be have a non-zero emissive value when they are built or rebuilt to work with NEE, but after that can have their emissiveness changed at will</li>
  <li>To set up PBR with the DEFAULT material, all textures go into their proper names, but Roughness goes into the Occlusion texture(This can be changed in the MaterialPairing menu)</li>
  <li>If you are using blendshapes to change geometry of a skinned mesh, you may need to go to the import settings of it(in the inspector), turn off Legacy Blendshape Normals, and make sure all normals are imported, not calculated, otherwise the normals for blendshapes might be wrong</li>
  <li>A fun thing you may want to do is go to TrueTrace -> Resources -> RenderPipelines -> RendererHandle, and uncomment the "[ImageEffectOpaque]"</li>
  <li>If you use HDRIs, or CubeMaps for the skybox, you need to format as the texture to a Texture2D in the inspector of the image, unity will convert it automatically, then put it in the slot in "Scene Settings" in the TrueTrace settings menu</li>
  <li>With multi-pass ReSTIR GI, the additional passes for spatial are in the RayTracingMaster script, where you can add more to the "Spatials" array.  X is spatial sample count, Y is spatial sample radius.</li>
</ul>

## Creating Panoramas
<ul>
    <li>Attatch the "PanoramaDoer" script to the "Scene" gameobject in the hierarchy</li>
    <li>Set your settings in the PanoramaDoer</li>
    <li>Enter Play Mode like normal and click the "Create Panorama" button in TrueTrace Settings</li>
    <li>The rest is automatic, from rendering, to stitching and will automatically exit play mode when finished</li>
    <li>The final Panorama will be put in Assets -> Screenshots, and the intermediate slices are in Assets -> TempPanorama</li>
</ul>

## Using Instancing
<ul>
  <li>THIS DOES NOT WORK WITH RT CORES</li>
  <li>Firstly, all objects that will be the source of instanced objects will need to go under the InstancedStorage and can be arranged like normal objects(with regards to the layout of parentobject to raytracingobjects)</li>
  <li>Then, to instance the objects, you just need GameObjects with the InstanceObject script attatched to them under the Scene GameObject, and then drag the desired object instance from the hierarchy to the Instance Parent slot in the InstanceObject script</li>
</ul>

## Linking your own Materials
<ul>
  <li>This is how to take your material, and have the textures assign properly, meaning you don't need to use a specific material</li>
  <li>In the PathTracingSettings, click the tab called "Material Pair Options"</li>
  <li>Drag any material that has the shader you want to pair into the material slot that appears</li>
  <li>From here, you will see 4 buttons, click those to add the input type and connect it to the output tab.  Metallic, roughness, matcapmask, and alpha are single channel texture</li>
  <li>Once this is done, click "Apply Material Links" and rebuild the BVH in the "Main Options" tab to update the objects in the scene</li>
</ul>

## Using OIDN
<ul>
  <li>Go to "Functionality Settings" in the TrueTrace Options, and check "Enable OIDN"</li>
</ul>

## Using HDRP(Should be automatic now)
<ul>
  <li>Go into TrueTrace -> Resources -> GlobalDefines.cginc, and uncomment the #define HDRP</li>
  <li>Create a new custom pass(Hierarchy -> Volume -> Custom Pass) and add the custom pass in the inspector called "HDRP Compatibility"</li>
</ul>

## Using Hardware RT
<ul>
  <li>First off, this REQUIRES unity 2023 or higher</li>
  <li>In the TrueTrace settings menu, click on the top right button "Functionality Settings" and toggle HardwareRT</li>
  <li>Then just use like normal, but this does not support Instances</li>
</ul>

## Using DX11 Only
<ul>
  <li>DX11 does not currently work with hue shift(seems to be a compiler bug)</li>
  <li>In the TrueTrace settings menu, click on the top right button "Functionality Settings" and toggle "Use DX11"</li>
</ul>

## Editor Window Guide
TrueTrace Options Description - 
<ul>
  <li>Build Aggregated BVH(Recommended to do any time you change objects in edit mode)- Allows you to pre-build objects BVH's before running so you dont have to wait every time you go into play mode for it to build.</li>
  <li>Clear Parent Data - Clears the data stored in parent GameObjects, allowing you to actually click them without lagging</li>
  <li>Take Screenshot - Takes a screenshot to the path under "Functionality Settings" in the TrueTrace options</li>
  <li>Auto Assign Scripts - Assigns all required scripts to all objects under the Scene GameObject, best way to add objects</li>
  <li>Make All Static - Utility button that takes all objects in the scene and puts them under one parent object, not recommended for general use</li>
  <li>Force Instances - Looks at all meshes in the scene, sees what objects have the same meshes, and makes them into instances, keep in mind instances use the same material and textures</li>
  <li>Remaining Objects - Objects still being processed</li>
  <li>Max Bounces - Sets the maximum number of bounces a ray can achieve</li>
  <li>Internal Resolution Ratio - Render scale in comparison to gameview size, turn to below 1 while in edit mode to decrease rendered resolution(to then be upscaled)</li>
  <li>Atlas Size - Maximum size of the texture atlas used(All textures are packed into atlas's so I can send them to the GPU)</li>
  <li>Use Russian Roulette - Highly recommended to leave this on, kills rays that may not contribute much early, and thus greatly increases performance</li>
  <li>Enable Object Moving - Allows objects to be moved during play, and allows for added objects to spawn in when they are done building</li>
  <li>Allow Image Accumulation - Allows the image to accumulate while the camera is not moving</li>
  <li>Use Next Event Estimation - Enables shadow rays/NEE for direct light sampling</li>
  <li>RIS Count - Number of RIS passes done for lights(select the best light out of X number of randomly selected lights, only works if LBVH is off in "GlobalDefines.cginc")</li>
  <li>Allow Mesh Skinning - Turns on the ability for skinned meshes to be animated or deformed with respect to their armeture</li>
  <li>Denoiser - Allows you to switch between different denoisers</li>
  <li>Allow Bloom - Turns on or off Bloom</li>
  <li>Sharpness Filter - Contrast Adaptive Sharpening</li>
  <li>Enable DoF - Turns on or off Depth of Field, and its associated settings</li>
  <li>Autofocus DoF - Sets the focal length to bring whatever is in the center of the screen into focus</li>
  <li>Enable Auto/Manual Exposure - Turns on or off Exposure</li>
  <li>Use ReSTIR GI - Enables ReSTIR GI which is usually much higher quality(Works with Recur and SVGF denoisers)</li>
  <li>Do Sample Connection Validation - Confirms that two samples are mutually visable and throws it away if they are not</li>
  <li>Update Rate - How many pixels per frame get re-traced to ensure they are still valid paths(7 or 33 is a good number to aim for here at 1080p)</li>]
  <li>Enable Temporal - Enables the Temporal pass of ReSTIR GI(allows samples to travel across time</li>
  <li>Temporal M Cap - How long a sample may live for, lower means lighting updates faster(until 0 which is the opposite) but more noise(recommended either 0 or around 12, but can be played with)</li>
  <li>Enable Spatial - Enables the Spatial pass of ReSTIR GI(Allows pixels to choose to use the neighboring pixels sample instead)</li>
  <li>Spatial Sample Count - How many neighboring pixels are looked at(turn to 0 to make it adapative to sample count)</li>
  <li>Minimum Spatial Radius - The minimum radius the spatial pass can sample from</li>
  <li>Enable TAA - Enables Temporal Antialiasing</li>
  <li>Enable Tonemapping - Turns on tonemapping, and allows you to select a specific tonemapper</li>
  <li>Enable TAAU - Use TAAU for upscaling(if off, you use my semi custom upscaler instead)</li>
  <li>Use Partial Rendering - Traces only 1 out of X rays</li>
  <li>Use AntiFirefly - Enables RCRS filter for getting rid of those single bright pixels</li>
  <li>RR Ignores Primary Hit - Allows for an extra bounce basically, makes it so that dark objects arent noisier, but at the cost of performance</li>
  <li>Atmospheric Scatter Samples - Lower this to 1 if you keep crashing on entering play mode(controls how many atmospheric samples are precomputed)</li>
  <li>Current Samples - Shows how many samples have currently been accumulated</li>
</ul>

## Materials(RayTracingObject script)
